First attempt at building a simple Google homepage
This is my attempt at the first Odin Project assignment. I started about 1 month ago, had my honeymoon and then picked back up where I left off. There was great turmoil since I forgot a lot of what I learned the first couple weeks. After numerous copies, pastes, inspecting and page sources I managed to create this page. A stray bracket was almost my demise, however the wonderful slack channel and community kept me from smashing my computer. I hope this gets easier.
